    "\r\n",
    " Before we get to the code, let's assign a Java data type to each of these pieces of data. As we mentioned in the last notebook, an age could be represented in Java with either an `int` or a `double` depending on how exact we want to be. In this case, we'll be using an `int` to represent the age. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    " Potential values for a students average score could be 85.5 or 52.7 or 94.0. These are all decimal values, so the data type for a students average score would be `double`. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    " A students first initial and last initial are each a single character, so both of these would be represented by the data type `char`.\r\n",
    " \r\n",
    " A student can either have perfect attendance or not have perfect attendance, there's no in between. So has perfect attendance should be a `boolean`. \r\n",

    " Let's try creating some Java code that represents these pieces of data. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    " We could represent a students age by just writing 21. Then we could represent a students average score with just 85.5. However, if you try running this, you'll get errors. "
