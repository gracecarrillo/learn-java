    "In this notebook, we'll look at how we can create a program that allows the user to input information affecting the program's output. Thinking back to our student program, we might need to update a student's `averageScore`. With some updates to the code, we can let the user dynamically change the value of a student's average score. \r\n",

There are lots of data types in Java, but for now you can think of the `Scanner` as a tool that has operations that allow us to get input. In order to use those operations, we have to create a `Scanner` first. We also need to `import java.util.Scanner` in order to use the `Scanner`. Think of it as a special data type that we need to import in order to use."
