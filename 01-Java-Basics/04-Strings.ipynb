    "# Strings in Java\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "So far, we've learned about a few data types. These data types, `int`, `boolean`, `double`, `char`, were primitive types. These are great for storing a whole number, true/false values, a single letter or symbol, but what if you wanted to store and reference some text, something that requires more than just a single character? \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll now be looking at the second overarching category of Java data types called reference types. And our first reference type is called a `string`. A `string` is a sequence of ordered characters. Before, we could represent a single character with a `char`, but now we can represent a word or a person's name with the `string` data type. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To create a `string`, we surround the series of characters with quotation marks. This represents a `string` value. To create a `string` variable, we just state the data type `string`, give the variable a label, and then use the assignment operator to assign the variable the `string` value. For example: \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "string myFavouriteWord = \"food\";\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " We should also note that the order of characters does matter. So let's say we have a `string` with `\"desserts,\"` and then we have a different `string` with `\"stressed.\"` Although these two strings have the same letters, they would not be considered as having equal value, because the letters are in different orders. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So what makes a string a reference type? Unlike primitive types and the other data types we've looked at, a string is built out of characters. It is not a basic data type. It is created out of organising `char` data pieces in a significant way. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now that we know about strings, let's create a string in Java. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using our program from the last notebook, we'll add a `studentName` variable that holds the student's name. We'll write `String studentName`, and in this case, the student's name will be `Molly Huq`. With the variable created, we'll print it out with `System.out.println` and the variable name `studentName`. We'll run this in the console. "

Instead, we could create two separate strings, one holding the first name and another holding the last name. Let's go ahead and do that. Instead of `studentName`, we'll write `studentFirstName`, and we'll move `Huq` to `String studentLastName` and have `Huq` be the value. Now `studentName` no longer exists, but `studentFirstName` does, so we'll print out the value of `studentFirstName`, as well as the value of `studentLastName`. We'll save this. Run it.

This means to extract the first initial of the first name we'll want to access the character at index zero, or the zeroth slot in the string. To do this we can use a special string operator to access the letters inside first name. To get the first character of the first name we can use an operation called `charAt`. \r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "So far, we've printed out the string `\"Hello world\"` individually, and a few variables individually. Now we are going to learn how to print them together in the same line. To do this, we need to combine string values with variables that hold strings in a print statement. Using the same example we've been working with, we can print out a student's full name, and say that student has an average score of `X`, with `X` being the student's current score. \r\n",

    "In the code, we'll write `System.out.println`, and then access the value of the student's first name, with `studentFirstName`. To add on the last name, we'll add a plus sign for concatenation, combining the value of these two strings. Then we'll type the variable that holds the student's last name, `studentLastName`. If we put the student's first and last name together like this, there will be no space between the first and last name when it is printed out to the user. We can add a space by adding a literal string, so a string that is not evaluated from a variable, with a space. \r\n",

We'll add on the literal string of `\"has a Score of,\"` with the plus sign, and then on the other side, we'll also concatenate the student's Score. This value is stored in the `averageScore` variable. \r\n",
