    "If statements aren't the only way we can add decision making to our programs. We also have loops. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A loop is similar to an if statement, except that it allows code to be executed repeatedly, based on a Boolean condition, instead of just one time.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "There are several different types of loops in Java, but the one we'll be focusing on is the **while loop**. A while loop looks like this:\r\n",

    "</p>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<br><br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We start at the Start, and then follow the arrow to check a condition. If that condition evaluates to `true`, we execute a series of statements, and then check the condition again. If that condition is `false`, we exit the loop, and continue to the rest of the code. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "On your smartphone, you've probably listened to music, and if you find a song you like, you put it on repeat. When a song is on repeat, it plays over and over again until you take it off repeat. We can represent this type of functionality in a Java program. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Filling in the condition of the while loop below, we can say our condition is: is current song on repeat? For the statements to execute, if the condition is true, we can print, `\"Playing same song on repeat\"` and give an option for the user to take the song off of repeat. If the condition is false, we can print, `\"Playing next song.\"` \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, if is current song on repeat is never `true`, then playing same song again will never be printed. We'll never repeat the song. If the user never takes the song off repeat, then the condition will always be `true`, and playing same song again will be continuously printed. That's why we call it a `while loop`. While the condition is true, keep running these given statements.\r\n",
