    "# Mapping out program control flow\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the last notebook, we've looked at how we can represent data in Java using data types and variables, as well as how to input and output data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, we are going to add some decision-making logic, that will allow our programs to have different outcomes. We saw this a little bit in the last lesson, when we printed out whatever the user inputted, but we can create more sophisticated control flow, using conditions. Let's break this down. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## What is a control flow? \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A program's control flow is the order in which the program's instructions are executed. All of the programs we've looked at so far execute one statement after the other. We created a variable, then printed the variable. Or we created one variable and then another variable and then printed them both. Each line of code was executed sequentially. For example, line one is executed before line two, line two is executed before line three and so on. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We can manipulate which line of code is executed with special control flow statements and conditions. With these control flow statements a line of code might never be executed, it might be executed once or it might be executed multiple times. The conditions determine how many times, if at all, a given line of code is executed. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's take a look at the control flow of a virtual fortune teller program. With the fortune teller, the user will pick a number between 1 and 10. Depending on the number the user picks, the user will receive a fortune. Let's dive into the diagram below. This maps out the control flow of our program and describes how we want our program to work. Notice, everything is not sequential. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We start at the start and the fortune teller, our program, will ask the user to pick a number between 1 and 10. The circle represents the start and the parallelogram represents input or output. The diamond represents the decision and that decision determines the choice and ultimately which print statement in fortune is run. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<br><br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\r\n",
    "  <img width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\" src=\"img\\control-flow.png\">\r\n",
    "</p>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<br><br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Our decision inside the diamond is asking the question: is `inputtedNum` less than five? This is our condition. Based on whether this is true or false, one of the true print statements will run.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If the inputted condition is less that five, meaning the condition is true, the lower left lock is run. If the `inputtedNum` is not less than five, meaning it is equal to five or greater than five, the lower right block is run. Only one of the fortune print statements will be run. Not both or neither. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, we know how to program some of this. We know how to output, pick a number between 1 and 10. We also know how to get access to the users input and save it to a variable. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We do not know how to implement or write Java code for a decision block. We call these decision blocks or control flow statements, because they make a decision about which code statements to run on each execution of our program. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In our case, the decision block is asking the question, if with the condition `inputtedNum` less than five. Depending on whether the condition is true or false, meaning if `inputtedNum` is less than five or not, a given code statement is run. Of course, right now, this is just a diagram. It's a representation of how we want our program to work in Java. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now that we have an idea on how we want our program to work, we can take this decision block in the diagram and break it down piece by piece, so that we can implement it in Java.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Operators in Java\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Thinking back to the decision block in our control flow, we have three main components:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- We have a condition, \r\n",
    "- the code that gets run if the condition is true, \r\n",
    "- and the code that gets run if the condition is false. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To simplify our condition, we can just write out our condition with the less than sign `<` instead of writing it out in English. This is closer to what it will look like in our code. Ultimately, the value of inputting them or the number that the user inputs will determine which print statement is run, which is exactly what we want. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We call the `<` sign a **relational operator**. Its inputs are `inputtedNum` and `5`. And the relational operator, `<`, states a comparison between these two inputs. The result of this overall comparison will evaluate to either `true` or `false`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Since the `inputtedNum < 5` comparison evaluates to a `boolean`, we call it a **boolean expression**. And a boolean expression can be used as a condition for our decision blocks. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Of course, `<` is just one relational operator. There are many others we could use here instead. This is a list of other relational operators we can use in our conditions. If we wanted to make our relational operator be less than or equal to instead of just less than`<`, we can add an equal sign `<=` and it would test if the `inputtedNum` is less than or equal to five. Similarly, for the greater than sign `>`, we would just add an equal sign to test if the `inputtedNum` is greater than or equal to eight `inputtedNum >= 8`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To check for equality, we would use double equal signs `==` and this would check if the `inputtedNum` is equal to eight, `inputtedNum == 8`. If it is, the statement would be `true`. If not, the statement would be `false`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To check for inequality, we use an exclamation point and an equal sign `!=`. In this case, the statement `inputtedNum =! 3` would be `true` as long as `inputtedNum` does not equal 3. It would be `false` in the case that `inputtedNum` equals three. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Ultimately, a condition in the decision block evaluates to true or false depending on some variable. That's what makes it a condition that can be evaluated during the program's execution and manipulate a program's control flow. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now that we have an idea of how decision-making works in our programs, let's try implementing the fortune teller logic in Java."
