If the `inputtedNum` is equal to or greater than five, the program should print out the shoe selection fortune.

    "In the Fortune Teller program, during the program's execution, only the `if` block or the `else` block were executed. All of this had to do with the topic called **scope**. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Scope refers to the region of the program where a piece of code is accessible or in which it can be used. Every time we use curly braces in Java, we are creating a block in the program. This is why the `if` block and the `else` block are separate. They are in different sets of curly brackets. Why does this matter? \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's say I created an int variable named `favouriteNumber`, with the value `5` in the `if` block. This variable scope is within the block in which it was created. That's where the variable is accessible and can be used. I can reference it or change its value anywhere inside the `if` block. However, since it was not created in the curly braces of the `else` block, it cannot be used in the `else` block, because the `else` block is outside this variable's scope. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, let's say we created a string variable called `favouriteFood` outside the `if-else` block in the main function and gave it the value, `\"pizza\"`. Since `favouriteFood` is created outside the `if-else` block in the parent set of parentheses, this variable can be accessed and assigned a new value within both the `if` and `else` block. The `favouriteFood` scope, or where `favouriteFood` can be accessed, is anywhere within the curly braces it was created in. \r\n",
