    "\r\n",
    "First, we need to write code that defines our triangle blueprint. And we can do that with the `Triangle` class. In Java, we can create a new class file and name it `Triangle.java`. We have created this for you already. It's in the `CodeSnippets/Triangle.java` path. \r\n",

    "We'll call this function `findArea` and it will return a `double`. We do need to have the return type here, because find area will not be a constructor. With the `this` keyword, we can get access to the appropriate instance variables based on height, so the function takes no inputs. Our formula for finding the area of a triangle, is base times height divided by two, so we'll return `this.base*this.height/2`. \r\n",
