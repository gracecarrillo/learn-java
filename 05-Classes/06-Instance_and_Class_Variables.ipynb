So, we do not add any parenthesis. We are accessing a variable, not calling a function. \r\n",

Just like we had static and non-static methods we have static and non-static variables. **Non-static variables** are the instance variables. The `base` of the triangle, the `height` of the triangle, they do not stay static or the same between triangle instances. The values of `base`, `height`, and the rest of our instance variables change depending on the triangle. A **static variable** is something that will not change per instance. They hold the value for the whole class to use. \r\n",

    "So what are the big takeaways from this chapter? First, in Java, we can create classes to organise our code. In our previous example, we used a `Triangle` class to organise data related to a triangle as well as how we can calculate things from triangle data. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A **class** contains attributes and behaviour, also called **properties** and **methods**. Every class also contains a **constructor**, which is a specific type of method that allows us to create instances of the class.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Ultimately, a class is just a blueprint, and we have to use the constructor in order to create triangles in our code. Some of these attributes are associated with each individual instance, and we call these **instance variables**. These were the `height`, `base`, and `sideLength` attributes in our example. These attributes are accessed with the instance itself, and we use the dot `.` operator on the instance to access instance variables. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Along with instance variables, each instance has instance functions or **non-static methods**. Similarly, these are accessed using the instance with the dot `.` operator and parentheses. We also have **class variables** and **class methods**. These variables and methods are static and we access them using the class name with the dot `.` operator. To use static class variables and methods, we do not need to create an instance, we can just use the class name. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This new vocabulary can sometimes be overwhelming, but when you are debugging, Googling, and trying to figure out how to fix your code, these words often come up. Understanding these concepts is a big hurdle in Java, and once you get it, everything starts to make more sense!"
