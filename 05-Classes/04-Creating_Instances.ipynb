    "Let's make some triangle instances. Continuing on our program from the last notebook, we'll move to another file. We'll create a `CreateInstances` class, with the `main` method, in order to do this. We could add a `main` method to our `Triangle` class, and run that file instead of this file, but I find the separation of our blueprints and the code we are actually running makes it a bit easier to understand at first. \r\n",

    "The reason we did `triangleA.findArea();` instead of `triangle.findArea();` is because in order to find the area of a given triangle, you have to have a triangle instance. You can't calculate the area of a triangle that doesn't exist yet. The implementation of the `findArea()` function relies on the attributes of a given triangle. The base might be 8 or 10 or 15. We don't know until the triangle is actually created. Because we have to have a triangle instance already created to use the `findArea` method, we can say `findArea` is an **instance method**. For `math.pow();`, we did not need to create an instance of `Math` in order to use the `pow` function. We just accessed the class and used the function we wanted. That's because `pow` is not an instance method. It is a static method or class method, because you do not need an instance of the class in order to use the function. Because of this, instance methods are often referred to as **non-static methods**, since you have to create an instance in order to use them. You do not need an instance created to use a static method. You can just reference the class. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    "In a previous notebook, we used `.chatAt()` with a string, and we did need a string already created in order to use it. In our code, we wrote `studentFirstName.charAt(0)` and `studentLastName.charAt(0)`, where the `studentFirstName` and the `studentLastName` both evaluated to string values. In both of these cases, we used the dot `.` operator on an instance of a string in order to get access to the `.charAt()` method. Because we used the dot `.` operator on an instance and not the class name, `.charAt()` is an instance method, and not a class method.\r\n",
