## Intro 

Java is one of the top five programming languages, and is used for websites, embedded controllers, and Android app development. In this crash course we will cover all the basics: data types, strings, functions, and loops. Then, we'll go over how to control the flow and logic of your code, and debug your project to make sure it runs perfectly. Along the way, we'll see some real-world examples and introduce challenges to allow you to practice your new skills. This course assumes no previous knowledge and is good for beginning programmers who want their first taste of this popular language.

## How to use

1. You will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are many popular IDE environments for programming. I use Visual Studio Code. If you use Windows, you can follow the instructions on how to install VS Code in your laptop or PC [on this link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20). Or if you use a Mac, [you can follow this link instead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4).

2. Once you have already installed VS Code, add Java support to it with the Java Extension Pack, a collection of extensions suggested by Microsoft: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack

3. Download this repo as a zip file and unzip it.

4. E-portfolio Evidence: Just focus on finishing the assignment. Then, write a short 500-1000 word reflection on the course, what you learned, if you managed to understand the assignment, how was it, if you didnâ€™t, why? And this, accompanied by screenshots of your work.
