    "# Sample solution: Find the errors\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's walk through how to find and solve errors in Exercise 2. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Our IDE should help us find any syntax errors, like a misspelled variable or missing parentheses or a missing curly bracket. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "On line 14, we see we're missing a semicolon. We have this red squiggly line and it says semicolon expected. So we'll add a semicolon to fix that error. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's run the program and see what our output is. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It says let's calculate the area of a triangle. Input the base of the triangle in inches. So we'll say three. We'll have the height be four. The area is four. Scrolling down, we see the area should be the base times height divided by two. Three times four is 12 divided by two is six but here it's saying the area is four. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's add some breakpoints and see if we can tell what's going on. Let's add a breakpoint on line 21 so we can see the value of base after we input a value. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll also add one on line 28 so we can see what the values of base and height are before we calculate the area. \r\n",
    "We'll also add a breakpoint on line 29 so we can see the final calculated area. Let's run in debug mode. And check out that internal state. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "First, we have to input a base. We'll use three as before and we stop at line 20. Our base variable has the value three which is good because that's what we inputted.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " Let's click Continue so then we'll go down to our double area line. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    " If we go back to our console, we still have to input a height. So we'll input four and then we hit line 28. Notice, in our IDE, it says the base is `3.0` and the height is `4.0`.\r\n",
    " \r\n",
    "So that means our base and height look good. Let's continue or step over and see that the area is calculated to be `6.0` which is exactly what we want. However, it looks like we're printing out the height instead of the area. To fix this, we can just write area instead of height. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's stop the program's execution and save. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll run it again and give it those same inputs. We'll give it three for the base, four for the height and we get six as our outputted area. Exactly what we expect. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's remove these breakpoints and see if we can break this program. There's one more error to find. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's hit Play. And we'll put a `-100` as the base. That doesn't work. So we'll try `10`. We'll try a five height and this works and so I gave it a negative base and then a positive base and then a positive height. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's run the program again. Another case we can have is where we have an initially positive base. So say `100` and then a negative height so we say `-10`. That's a valid please input the base of the triangle. So this means we have some kind of error. We'll try just `10`. All right, `-50`. `20`. Although `-50` was not valid, `20` is valid and `10` is valid. Why isn't this working? \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We need to add some breakpoints so let's stop the program and try adding some. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's add a breakpoint at the print statement. The while loop as well as when we reset the height. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So let's play this again in Debug mode. We'll input a regular base `10` for the triangle and then we'll try a negative height so say `-50`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "All right, we have hit line 21, our first breakpoint. It says height is set to `-50`. Height is less than zero so we're going to enter this while loop. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll click step over. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We get this invalid, that's invalid. Please input the base of the triangle so we actually want to change this to height because the height of the triangle, not the base is invalid. And then we'll click to the next line and see base equals `inputted.nextDouble`. So the next thing we input, it's actually getting set to the base instead of the height. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So here we need to change this to height instead of base. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's save this, stop the program's execution and try running again. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll hit Play, go back to our console. We'll input the base at `10`. We'll input a height of `-50`. We'll try a height of `20`. And that is valid, we get an area of `100`. `20` times `10` is `200` divided by two is `100` so that area is also valid. So those are our three errors. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Of course, there's never just one way to solve an error. And there are even other ways to implement this program. This is just one solution. Yours may look different. In the next topic, we'll take a look at a new way we can structure our programs with functions."
