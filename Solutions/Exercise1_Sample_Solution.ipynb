    "# Sample solution: Multiple choice\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's walk through how to create a multiple-choice program in Java. Remember this is a sample solutions. This means there are other ways of solving this exercise. This is just the way I did it. Yours doesn't have to look the same!\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the exercise notebook, you had a template. The first thing we need to do is come up with our question and answer choices. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Our question will be: `\"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\"` The answer choices will be `Earth`, `Jupiter`, and `Saturn`. We set the correct answer choice to be equal to choice two because `Jupiter` is the largest planet in the solar system.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Next we'll ask our question. Then we'll give the user some answer choices. To retrieve the users input we create a scanner using `System.in` and you use the `.next` operation. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now for the control flow portion. We can use an if statement to check if the users input matches the correct answer. If the condition is true we'll print out a congrats message. If the user is not correct then the user must have inputted something that is not equal to the value of correct answer. We can add an else to our if statement so that a message stating the user is incorrect is printed in this case. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "All right, let's try running the program. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "`\"What is the largest planet in our solar system?\"`\r\n",
    "`\"Choose one of the following, Earth, Jupiter, or Saturn.\"` \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's try `Earth`, you are incorrect. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The correct answer is `Jupiter`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's try `Saturn`. That is also incorrect. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll try one more with `Jupiter`. That is the correct answer, congrats. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The if statement is the main reason that we got different outputs depending on our input. In the condition we check if the correct answer `Jupiter` equals whatever the user, we, have inputted. Only when our input equals `Jupiter` we get this correct answer message."

    "We don't want our condition to be case-sensitive. We could fix it in this case by changing all of our answer choices to having lowercase first letters making them fully lowercase. A full lowercase `jupiter` will work but other versions of it will not work. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To make it work for the other versions we need to convert our input to lowercase. We can fix this by using a string operation called `toLowerCase`. This will convert the users input to lowercase. This way it doesn't matter what caps we use to enter `Jupiter`. All of these versions work."

Make sure you check out the *Additional Resources* section to learn more about them!\r\n",
