    "\r\n",
    "Let's represent a student's profile in Java using a class. We'll create a new Java file and call it, `StudentProfile.java`. In this class, we'll add our attributes. Each attribute or instance variable will have a data type. So we'll start with `firstName`, which will be `string`. Same wiht `lastName` and `declaredMajor`. Then `averageScore` will be a `double`. And `expectedYeartoGraduate` will be an `int`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Next, we'll add our behaviour or instance methods. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The exercise said to add a function that increments the `expectedYeartoGraduate` instance variable. So we'll write `public` and then the name of the function, `incrementExpectedGraduationYear()`. It will take no parameters. And for the return type, we could have it return the new `expectedYeartoGraduate` value or return nothing, returning `void`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this case, we'll say `void`. In the implementation, we'll be setting the value of the instance variable `expectedYeartoGraduate`. To access this instance variable, we can use the keyword `this` with the dot `.` operator. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For the assignment, we want to access the current value of `expectedYeartoGraduate` and add one. We can do this by writing this dot `expectedYeartoGraduate` and then plus one. And that's our implementation. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Moving on to the constructor, we'll write `public`, the name of the class, student profile and in the parenthesis we'll add our parameters. Each of these parameters should map back to an attribute. So we'll have one for `firstName`, `lastName` with the parameters in order, we can set each attribute to the value that they're corresponding parameter is holding. To access the attribute, we use the `this` keyword. Starting with `firstName`, we'd write this dot `firstName`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Then, we'll assign that the value of the parameter `firstName`. Next, we'll do the same for `lastName`."
