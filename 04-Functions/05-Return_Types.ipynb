    "# Return types in Java\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "So far, the only way we've outputted data is `System.out.println`, and this really outputs data to the user. We've gathered input from the user in the past with the scanner, and in the last lesson, we learned how to input data into functions using parameters. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now we're going to learn how to output data from functions using **return types**. We'll talk more about return types in a second, but imagine you go to a restaurant with four of your friends, and you all order similarly priced meals and want to tip and tax the same amount. The listed meal price comes out to be `$100`. You want to tip 20%, or `.20`, as a group, and the sales tax is `.08`, 8%. With the function you created in the last notebook, we can calculate the total meal cost, which will come out to `128`, and that would get printed out to the console. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now what if we wanted to split the bill among me and my friends? The total meal cost is `128`, but I want to know what each person owes on the bill. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We could add a parameter to our function that represents the number of people at the meal and divide the final result by that number, but then the function name doesn't really make sense, because the printed-out statement should represent the total meal cost, not my portion. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "What I really want to do is somehow get access to the data outputted by the `calculateTotalMealPrice()` function and manipulate it some more. I want to divide it by five. We can do this with return types. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For the functions we've created, we've always prefixed them with `public static void`. **Void** is actually the return type. Every function in Java returns some value or nothing, and every function we've created so far has returned `void`, or nothing. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For the `calculateTotalMealPrice()` function, we want to return the value of the result variable. The result variable is a `double`, so we'll change `void` to `double` to make `double` our return type. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "With the `double` return type, we have to make our function return a `double` value. We can do this using the `return` keyword. We'll write `return` and then the value we want the function to return, in this case, the value stored inside of result. \r\n"

    "\r\n",
