    "\r\n",
    "For example, let's say I wanted to calculate the total cost of a meal including tip and tax. To calculate this we would first figure out the tip by multiplying the tip rate with the listed price of the meal. We would figure out the tax by multiplying the tax rate with the listed price of the meal as well. Then we would add the tip, tax, and listed price of the meal and output the result. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These are finite steps that we can label `calculateTotalMealPrice();`. Of course, almost every meal you order will have a different listed price. And sometimes you might want to tip a different rate depending on what service you get. And sometimes you might want to tip a different rate depending on the service you get. Sales tax rates also differ depending on what state or country you are in. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    "How can we account for this in our function? What value could we possibly give listed meal price, tip rate, and tax rate if they change every time? \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to create a function with inputs. Adding inputs is going to allow us to insert a specific listed meal price, tip break, and tax rate into the function every time we call the function. The listed meal price, tip rate, and tax rate inputs will be defined in the functions definition. But the values of these inputs will be assigned when we use the function or call the function. \r\n",
