    "# Debugging syntax and logical errors\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When we are writing code sometimes we can make a mistake and get an error. These errors can cause our code to give the wrong output or crash our program entirely. And you've probably already experienced a little bit of this in the workshop so far.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You may have heard of the term **debugging** before. And this process involves locating and correcting code errors in your program. We often call these errors bugs, because [computer scientist pioneer Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) coined the term bug when she found a moth causing an error in her early computer. \r\n",
    " \r\n",
    "In this notebook we'll look at some strategies for how to debug your programs and how to fix some common errors. Before we can solve errors, we have to understand how our program is executing code so that we can find them. One way we can understand how our program is working more fully and locate an error is by using print statements. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's take a look at our multiple choice program from the last topic, but with a few errors introduced. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Syntax Errors\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The first errors in the program we going to look at are **syntax errors**, or syntax bugs. Syntax errors often cause your program to fail before it's even executed. Because the computer has to understand your code in order to run it. This means if something's misspelled, or a certain symbol is missing, the program won't run, because your code is not in the right format. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "So let's find some syntax errors in this program. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These can be easier to find with an IDE, because an IDE tells you what line has the error. It may not be that specific line you have to change, but it's probably something around it. Let's take a look! "

    "All right, so we can run the program, but there are still some errors here. One bug is that although I put in the correct answer, `Jupiter`, it told me I was incorrect. These errors are different from syntax errors because they deal with the logic of our program. We call these errors **logical errors**. \r\n",

    "In order to debug this, we often look for parts of the program that aren't working as expected. Find its respective code, and in this case, add some print statements to find it, and fix it. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Going back to the code, let's try outputting what the value of `correctAnswer` is, as well as what the value of our input is. To make sure it's getting the right input, as well as the correct answer is what we want it to be. So we'll write, `System.out.println(input)`. And then the `correctAnswer`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll save this. We'll run it. We'll type in `jupiter`. In the console, our input is shown as `jupiter`, which is what we expect. But the value of `correctAnswer` is actually `saturn`. If we scroll up to where `correctAnswer` is defined, we see its value is `choiceThree`. If we go to where `choiceThree` is defined, its value is `saturn`. The correct answer should be `choiceTwo`, so we'll change `choiceThree` to `choiceTwo`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "And now our program is fixed. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Let's take out our print statements and run the program again. We'll try it with `jupiter`. And that is the correct answer. Let's try it with one of the incorrect answers, so in this case we'll say `saturn`. And it says that is incorrect, the correct answer is `jupiter`. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We debugged the code. Now, this is a fairly trivial example. But as our programs get more complicated, understanding the values of our variables and the way our program is executing code becomes more and more important."
